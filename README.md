# hello-world
My_First_Github

First time creating "Hello, World" to learn how to create a new repository on Github

New Branch/Folder structure:
Accorrding to my observation (Hello-world/README.md), READMe.md is a folder(or a file) which is a complete copy of the master that has Unix-like Folder structure, Hello-world is the master folder, and README.md is the sub-folder

Commit/Saved-changes:
Once you hit the green button "commit" at the bottom of this edit page. The modification will be saved to the file. Therefore, commit is the action that saved the change to your file. 

Commit message/Descriptive changed message
A commit message, a descriptive message to describe what you have changed to the original file can be added to the file along with the commit action.
